# LCP

## Installation

install_github("LeyingGuan/LCP")


## Performing LCP construction
You can find two examples using LCP under man/examples.

1. Example 1 performs LCP with user-specified h.
2. Example 2 performs LCP with auto-tuned h. 

If you want to rerun all numerical examples [1], you can find relevant codes under https://github.com/LeyingGuan/LCPexperiments, and in which case, please make sure that you have properly installed  torch, torchvision, and XRPython.
